# Blockchain Bandit

## Overview
Blockchain Bandit is a security research project focused on identifying vulnerabilities in blockchain networks. It demonstrates how weak private keys and smart contract exploits can be targeted and provides tools for analysis and prevention.

## Features
- Identifies weak or compromised private keys.
- Scans and detects smart contract vulnerabilities.
- Monitors blockchain transactions for suspicious activity.
- Provides security recommendations to protect blockchain assets.
